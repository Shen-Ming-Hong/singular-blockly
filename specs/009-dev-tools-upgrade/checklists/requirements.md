# Specification Quality Checklist: 開發工具依賴升級

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] Edge cases are identified
-   [x] Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Pass - Content Quality

-   Specification focuses on developer needs (code quality, configuration alignment, upgrade evaluation)
-   Written in Traditional Chinese as required
-   No framework-specific implementation details in requirements
-   All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Constitution Alignment) completed

### ✅ Pass - Requirement Completeness

-   All 10 functional requirements are clear and testable
-   No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
-   8 success criteria defined with specific measurable metrics:
    -   SC-001: Lint results consistency (binary: pass/fail)
    -   SC-002: ES2023 syntax support (testable with code examples)
    -   SC-003: Research document with 4 specific deliverables
    -   SC-004: Compilation time within ±10% (4 seconds baseline)
    -   SC-005: Test pass rate (189/190 tests minimum)
    -   SC-006: Bundle size range (124KB - 137KB)
    -   SC-007: 10 manual test scenarios enumerated
    -   SC-008: Changelog update (verifiable)
-   All acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
-   5 edge cases identified covering dependency conflicts, incompatibility, script changes, type errors, performance
-   Scope clearly bounded to 3 specific upgrades

### ✅ Pass - Feature Readiness

-   Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios:
    -   FR-001, FR-002: User Story 1, 2 acceptance scenarios
    -   FR-003, FR-004: User Story 3 acceptance scenario 1
    -   FR-005: All user stories (npm scripts validation)
    -   FR-006, FR-007, FR-008: Success criteria SC-001, SC-002, SC-005, SC-006
    -   FR-009: Success criteria SC-003 (research documentation)
    -   FR-010: Constitution Alignment section
-   3 user stories prioritized (P1, P1, P2) covering all upgrade aspects
-   User stories are independently testable:
    -   US1: Can test ESLint plugin upgrade in isolation
    -   US2: Can test config change independently
    -   US3: Can research and test webpack-cli separately
-   Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tools/APIs in measurement)

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items complete

**Strengths**:

1. Clear prioritization with P1/P2 labels enabling incremental delivery
2. Comprehensive edge case analysis (5 scenarios)
3. Success criteria include both automated (SC-001 to SC-006) and manual tests (SC-007)
4. Research-driven approach aligns with project constitution (Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2)
5. Realistic metrics based on project baselines (190 tests, ~4s compile time, 130KB bundle)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (no clarifications needed)
