# Tasks: Architecture Refactoring and Code Cleanup

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-refactor-architecture-cleanup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT required for this refactoring - existing test suite validates all changes

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each refactoring phase

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

-   **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-   **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
-   Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a **single TypeScript project** with VSCode extension structure:

-   Extension logic: `src/` at repository root
-   WebView assets: `media/` at repository root
-   Tests: `src/test/` at repository root

---

## Phase 0: Research & Verification (MCP-Powered) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: Research phase already completed during planning - see [research.md](./research.md)

**Key Findings Documented**:

-   ‚úÖ FileService API fully mapped (all methods async Promise-based)
-   ‚úÖ Directory scanning pattern validated (fs.promises.readdir + filter)
-   ‚úÖ Temp file naming strategy confirmed (timestamp-based unique files)
-   ‚úÖ Constant conventions established (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with unit suffixes)
-   ‚úÖ Multi-window safety verified (timestamp precision sufficient)

**No additional research tasks needed** - proceed to implementation

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: Project structure already exists and is functional

**Existing Infrastructure**:

-   ‚úÖ TypeScript project configured (tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js)
-   ‚úÖ Testing framework setup (Mocha, Sinon, @vscode/test-electron)
-   ‚úÖ Linting configured (eslint.config.mjs)
-   ‚úÖ Service layer established (FileService, LocaleService, SettingsManager)

**Independent Test**: Only one locale loading method exists, both main editor and preview load all 15 languages correctly, all tests pass

### Implementation for User Story 3

-   [x] T023 [US3] Created unified `loadLocaleScripts(webview: vscode.Webview)` method (renamed from loadLocaleFiles)
-   [x] T024 [US3] Retained all locale file discovery logic in unified method (getSupportedLocales + URI generation)
-   [x] T025 [US3] Webview parameter already present for URI generation (no changes needed)
-   [x] T026 [US3] No isPreview parameter needed (both editor and preview use identical logic)
-   [x] T027 [US3] Updated `getWebviewContent()` to call `loadLocaleScripts(webview)`

**Checkpoint**: Single locale loading method, 50% code duplication eliminated, test baseline maintained ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Improve Temporary File Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement timestamp-based unique temp file naming to prevent multi-window conflicts and enable proper cleanup

**Independent Test**: Multiple Blockly editors open simultaneously without file conflicts, temp files cleaned up on window close

### Implementation for User Story 4

-   [x] T034 [US4] Added `private currentTempToolboxFile: string | null = null` property to WebViewManager class
-   [x] T035 [US4] Created `generateTempToolboxPath(): string` helper using `Date.now()` for unique timestamps

-   [ ] T059 [US5] Manual test: Delete dummy file, verify it's no longer loaded

**Checkpoint**: Arduino modules auto-discovered, no hardcoded lists, extensible without code changes ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Improve Code Readability with Named Constants (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Extract magic numbers to descriptive constants for better maintainability

**Independent Test**: No hardcoded timeout/delay numbers remain in code, all constants have clear names with unit suffixes

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Research (Phase 0)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - findings in research.md
-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - project infrastructure exists
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Run immediately - validates test baseline
-   **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: Each story CAN be done independently after Phase 2, but recommended order is by priority (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
-   **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Priority 1 (P1) - Can start immediately after Phase 2**:

-   **User Story 1 (Remove Empty Dirs)**: ZERO dependencies, ZERO risk ‚Üí **DO THIS FIRST**
-   **User Story 2 (FileService Integration)**: Independent, can be done in parallel with US1

**Priority 2 (P2) - Recommended after P1 complete**:

-   **User Story 3 (Locale Deduplication)**: Depends on US2 (FileService) completion for consistency
-   **User Story 4 (Temp File Handling)**: Independent, can be done in parallel with US3

**Priority 3 (P3) - Final polish**:

-   **User Story 5 (Dynamic Modules)**: Independent, can be done in parallel with US6
-   **User Story 6 (Extract Constants)**: Independent, can be done in parallel with US5

### Within Each User Story

-   **User Story 1**: All tasks sequential (delete dirs one by one)
-   **User Story 2**: Must convert methods in order (async first, then replace fs calls, then remove import)
-   **User Story 3**: Must create unified method before deleting old methods
-   **User Story 4**: Must create properties/methods before using them
-   **User Story 5**: Must implement discovery method before updating HTML
-   **User Story 6**: Tasks T060-T063 (define constants) CAN run in parallel, then T064-T066 (replace usage) sequential

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within User Story 6 (Constants)**:

```bash
# Define all constants in parallel (different files):
Task T061: "Define BOARD_CONFIG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS in messageHandler.ts"
Task T062: "Define UI_STABILIZATION_DELAY_MS in messageHandler.ts"
Task T063: "Define PANEL_REVEAL_DELAY_MS in extension.ts"
```

**Between User Stories (if team capacity allows)**:

```bash
# After Phase 2 complete, launch multiple stories:
Developer A: User Story 1 (Remove Dirs) - 30 minutes
Developer B: User Story 2 (FileService) - 2 hours
Developer C: User Story 6 (Constants) - 1 hour

# After P1 complete:
Developer A: User Story 3 (Deduplication) - 1 hour
Developer B: User Story 4 (Temp Files) - 1.5 hours

# After P2 complete:
Developer A: User Story 5 (Dynamic Modules) - 2 hours
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 User Stories Working Together

**Scenario**: Two developers working in parallel after Phase 2 baseline established

**Developer A starts User Story 1**:

```bash
# Quick win - 30 minutes total
rm -rf src/modules/core/
rm -rf src/modules/features/
# ... delete other dirs
npm test  # Verify
```

**Developer B starts User Story 2** (in parallel):

```bash
# Longer task - 2 hours
# Edit webviewManager.ts:
# - Convert getWebviewContent() to async
# - Replace fs.readFileSync with fileService.readFile
# - Convert paths to relative
npm test  # Verify
```

**Result**: Both stories complete independently, can be merged separately, no conflicts

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Sequential by Priority

**Rationale**: This is a refactoring project with shared files (webviewManager.ts). Sequential execution minimizes merge conflicts and allows thorough testing at each step.

1. **Phase 2: Foundational** (10 minutes)
    - Run tests, establish baseline
2. **Phase 3: User Story 1** (30 minutes) - **QUICK WIN** üéØ
    - Delete empty directories
    - Validate tests pass
    - **Deploy/commit immediately** - zero risk change
3. **Phase 4: User Story 2** (2 hours)
    - FileService integration
    - Test thoroughly (most critical refactoring)
    - Commit and validate
4. **Phase 5: User Story 3** (1 hour)
    - Locale deduplication
    - Test both editor and preview
    - Commit
5. **Phase 6: User Story 4** (1.5 hours)
    - Temp file handling
    - Test multi-window scenarios
    - Commit
6. **Phase 7: User Story 5** (2 hours)
    - Dynamic module loading
    - Test extensibility
    - Commit
7. **Phase 8: User Story 6** (1 hour)
    - Extract constants
    - Final validation
    - Commit
8. **Phase 9: Polish** (1 hour)
    - Documentation updates
    - Full smoke test
    - Final commit

**Total Estimated Time**: ~9 hours (single developer, sequential execution)

### Alternative: Parallel Execution (if multiple developers)

**Phase 2 Complete ‚Üí Launch in Parallel**:

-   Dev A: US1 (30 min) ‚Üí US3 (1 hr) ‚Üí US5 (2 hr) = 3.5 hours
-   Dev B: US2 (2 hr) ‚Üí US4 (1.5 hr) = 3.5 hours
-   Dev C: US6 (1 hr) ‚Üí Help with integration = 1+ hours

**Integration**: Merge US1 first (no conflicts), then US2, US6 (different files), then US3, US4, US5

**Total Parallel Time**: ~4 hours (with 3 developers, careful coordination)

### MVP Definition

**MVP = User Story 1 ONLY** (30 minutes)

-   Delete empty directories
-   Validate tests pass
-   Deploy

**Rationale**: US1 is zero-risk, instant value (reduced confusion), independently deliverable. Perfect MVP for immediate impact.

**Suggested MVP**: User Story 1 only (8 tasks, 30 minutes, zero risk)

---

## Format Validation

‚úÖ **All tasks follow required format**: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`

**Checklist Compliance**:

-   ‚úÖ Every task starts with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
-   ‚úÖ Every task has sequential ID (T001, T002, T003...)
-   ‚úÖ [P] marker only on parallelizable tasks (6 tasks)
-   ‚úÖ [Story] label on all user story phase tasks (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
-   ‚úÖ No story labels on Setup, Foundational, or Polish phases
-   ‚úÖ All descriptions include file paths or command/action
-   ‚úÖ Task IDs in execution order (T001 ‚Üí T079)

**Example Format Validation**:

-   ‚úÖ `- [ ] T004 [US1] Delete empty directory src/modules/core/`
-   ‚úÖ `- [ ] T012 [US2] Convert getWebviewContent() method to async in src/webview/webviewManager.ts`
-   ‚úÖ `- [ ] T061 [P] [US6] Define BOARD_CONFIG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS constant with JSDoc in src/webview/messageHandler.ts`

---

## Notes

-   **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies on other tasks
-   **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
-   **No tests required**: Existing test suite validates all refactoring
-   **File paths included**: Every task specifies exact location of changes
-   **Independent user stories**: Each story can be completed and tested separately
-   **Constitution aligned**: All refactoring follows Singular Blockly constitution principles
-   **Research complete**: All technical decisions documented in research.md
-   **Sequential recommended**: Single file (webviewManager.ts) edited by multiple stories - sequential execution minimizes conflicts
-   **MVP ready**: User Story 1 can deploy immediately (30 minutes, zero risk)
