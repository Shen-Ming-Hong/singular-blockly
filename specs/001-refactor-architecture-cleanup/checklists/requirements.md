# Specification Quality Checklist: Architecture Refactoring and Code Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] Edge cases are identified
-   [x] Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### âœ… All Checks Passed

**Content Quality Assessment**:

-   Specification focuses on WHAT (outcomes) not HOW (implementation)
-   Each user story describes developer/user value without mentioning TypeScript, Node.js, or specific APIs
-   Language is accessible to project managers and stakeholders
-   All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Constitution Alignment) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:

-   No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
-   Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-028) is testable with clear pass/fail criteria
-   Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "Zero direct imports of Node's fs module", "50% reduction in code duplication")
-   Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., SC-009 measures bug reports, not code metrics)
-   Edge cases cover failure scenarios (file operations fail, permission errors, rapid instance creation)
-   Scope is bounded by 6 prioritized user stories with clear phases
-   Assumptions section documents FileService API expectations, test coverage assumptions, and lifecycle behavior

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:

-   Each of 28 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
-   User stories cover all refactoring aspects: directory cleanup, FileService integration, deduplication, temp file handling, dynamic loading, and constant extraction
-   Success criteria SC-001 through SC-009 directly validate the requirements
-   Specification remains technology-agnostic while being specific about outcomes (e.g., "reduces directories by 5" not "deletes src/modules using rm -rf")

## Notes

**Specification is ready for implementation planning** (`/speckit.plan`)

This refactoring specification is exceptionally well-suited for incremental development:

-   Each user story (P1, P2, P3) can be implemented independently
-   P1 items (directory cleanup, FileService integration) provide immediate value with minimal risk
-   P2 items (deduplication, temp file handling) build on P1 foundation
-   P3 items (dynamic loading, constants) are pure quality-of-life improvements
-   All 6 phases have clear, testable acceptance criteria
-   Constitution alignment ensures changes strengthen existing architecture patterns

**No clarifications needed** - all requirements are unambiguous and actionable.
