# Specification Quality Checklist: Safe Dependency Updates (Phase 1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] Edge cases are identified
-   [x] Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **PASS**: Specification focuses on dependency update outcomes without prescribing specific implementation approaches. Uses terms like "系統必須" (system must) to describe requirements from a functional perspective.

✅ **PASS**: All content centered on developer value (better tooling, stability, performance) and project needs (security updates, maintainability).

✅ **PASS**: While targeting developers as end-users, the spec uses plain language to describe what needs to be achieved rather than how to achieve it.

✅ **PASS**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Constitution Alignment) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are explicit with specific version numbers and validation criteria.

✅ **PASS**: Every requirement includes testable criteria:

-   FR-001 to FR-013: Specific version upgrades with validation through commands
-   FR-014 to FR-019: Process requirements with clear verification steps
-   FR-020 to FR-023: Quality gates with specific pass/fail criteria

✅ **PASS**: All success criteria include measurable metrics:

-   SC-001: Verifiable via `npm list` command
-   SC-002: 10% performance threshold
-   SC-003: 87.21% coverage threshold
-   SC-004: ±5% file size variance
-   SC-005 to SC-010: Specific time/platform/functionality checks

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria describe outcomes without mentioning implementation tools:

-   Uses "測試套件執行時間" (test suite execution time) not "Jest execution time"
-   Uses "建置產出" (build output) not "Webpack bundle"
-   Uses "擴充功能正常啟動" (extension starts normally) not "VS Code API loads correctly"

✅ **PASS**: All four user stories have comprehensive acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format.

✅ **PASS**: Five edge cases identified covering:

-   Backward compatibility issues
-   Test failure analysis
-   Build output changes
-   Dependency conflicts
-   Cross-platform consistency

✅ **PASS**: Clear scope boundaries defined in "Out of Scope" section, explicitly excluding higher-risk upgrades (Blockly, @types/node, webpack-cli major versions).

✅ **PASS**:

-   Assumptions section covers environment prerequisites (Node.js 20.x, npm ci usage, semver compliance)
-   Dependencies section lists internal (none) and external dependencies (npm registry, GitHub Actions, VSCode dev environment)
-   Risks section identifies three risks with mitigation strategies

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **PASS**: Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories:

-   FR-001 to FR-004 → User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
-   FR-005 to FR-008 → User Story 2 acceptance scenarios
-   FR-009 to FR-011 → User Story 3 acceptance scenarios
-   FR-012 to FR-013 → User Story 4 acceptance scenarios

✅ **PASS**: Four user stories cover complete upgrade workflow:

-   P1: TypeScript ecosystem (foundation)
-   P2: Testing framework (validation layer)
-   P3: Build tools (delivery mechanism)
-   P3: ESLint (quality assurance)

✅ **PASS**: Ten success criteria directly map to feature requirements and provide measurable validation for all aspects of the upgrade (compatibility, performance, coverage, functionality, cross-platform).

✅ **PASS**: Specification maintains abstraction:

-   Refers to "套件" (packages) not specific npm commands
-   Describes "測試通過" (tests pass) not specific test framework APIs
-   Uses "建置工具" (build tools) not Webpack-specific terminology

## Notes

✅ **All validation items passed**. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

### Strengths

-   Comprehensive edge case coverage addressing practical upgrade concerns
-   Clear prioritization rationale for each user story with independent testability
-   Detailed measurable outcomes with specific thresholds (87.21% coverage, ±5% file size, 110% compile time)
-   Well-defined "Out of Scope" section prevents scope creep
-   Risk mitigation strategies for identified concerns

### Recommendations for Planning Phase

-   Consider creating automated baseline capture script for pre-upgrade metrics
-   Plan for cross-platform validation strategy (Windows/macOS/Linux test matrix)
-   Design rollback procedure documentation as part of implementation
-   Consider creating upgrade checklist tool to track each package validation step

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR `/speckit.plan`
