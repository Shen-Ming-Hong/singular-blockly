# Specification Quality Checklist: TXT 虛擬控制主題一致性

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass completed on 2026-05-22.
- Scope is explicitly limited to TXT virtual controls in edit and preview modes; non-TXT behavior remains out of scope and protected by FR-012.
- Product decisions are captured in the Clarifications section: new standalone spec, preserve stored button colors, include accessibility and high-contrast support.
- No additional clarification questions are required before `/speckit.plan`.
