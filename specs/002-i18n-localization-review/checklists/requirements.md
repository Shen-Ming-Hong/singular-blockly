# Specification Quality Checklist: Internationalization Localization Quality Review and Improvement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] Edge cases are identified
-   [x] Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Specification Strengths

1. **Clear User Focus**: The specification excellently articulates the problem from actual user perspectives (Japanese educators, Korean students, German users, etc.) with specific cultural context
2. **Prioritization Logic**: User stories are well-prioritized with P1 focusing on audit and high-impact fixes, P2 on guidelines, and P3 on automation - this represents a sensible MVP approach
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: SC-001 through SC-008 provide concrete, measurable targets (30% faster comprehension, 90% reviewed strings, 40% reduction in support tickets) that are truly technology-agnostic
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: The specification demonstrates deep understanding of localization vs translation distinction with examples like Japanese "制御" terminology and Taiwan's maker education curriculum
5. **Independence of Stories**: Each user story can be implemented and tested independently, enabling true iterative delivery

### Specific Quality Highlights

-   **Edge Cases**: Thoughtfully addresses real localization challenges (pluralization, regional variants, text length overflow, evolving terminology standards)
-   **Assumptions Section**: Explicitly documents what's being assumed (native speaker access, stable terminology standards, UI layout flexibility) which helps scope management
-   **Dependencies**: Clearly identifies external needs (native speaker reviewers, user testing capability, cultural research resources)
-   **Constitution Alignment**: Genuinely demonstrates how this aligns with project principles rather than boilerplate - e.g., "Prioritizes high-impact translations over comprehensive perfection"

### Validation Results

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase without requiring clarification or revision.

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to implementation planning. The specification provides sufficient clarity for creating actionable implementation tasks.
