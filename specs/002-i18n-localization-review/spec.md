## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

-   Q: When CI/CD translation quality checks fail on a PR, what should be the enforcement behavior? → A: Warn + Allow - Display warning messages but allow merge, giving final decision power to reviewers
-   Q: Who has permission to modify whitelist rules and what is the change approval process? → A: PR + maintainer review
-   Q: How long should audit report JSON files be retained in the repository? → A: Keep last 6 months
-   Q: If ≤5 high-severity issues remain after whitelist optimization and no volunteers available, what is the handling strategy? → A: Document + Accept - Record remaining issues as tolerable state and close issue
-   Q: How to detect when whitelist rules become obsolete due to translation file changes? → A: Audit Stats Monitoring - Monitor per-rule filtering statistics for anomalous drops

### 🔄 In Progress

-   **User Story 1**: Automated False Positive Validation
    -   Ongoing: Refine whitelist rules to reduce remaining 19 high-severity issues
    -   Goal: Achieve ≤5 high-severity issues through rule optimization
    -   Approach: Pattern analysis and linguistic rule expansion

### ⏳ Planned (Blocked - Awaiting Volunteer Contributors)

-   **User Story 2**: Create Localization Guidelines
    -   Status: ⏸️ **Paused** - Requires native speaker input
    -   Alternative: Can be started by documenting automation patterns as interim guidelines
-   **User Story 3**: Fix High-Impact Translations
    -   Status: ⏸️ **Paused** - Requires native speaker validation
    -   Alternative: Can prepare machine-suggested improvements for future review

### 🔄 Achievable Without Native Speakers

-   **User Story 4 (Phase 2)**: CI/CD Integration
    -   Next: Automate whitelist filtering in GitHub Actions
    -   Goal: Auto-comment on PRs with translation quality warnings

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Automated False Positive Filtering (Priority: P0 - Critical)

**Updated Strategy (2025-10-22)**: Due to lack of available native speaker volunteers, this story has been refocused on **maximizing automation** to eliminate false positives, reducing manual review burden to near-zero.

Maintainers need an automated system that accurately identifies genuine translation quality issues while filtering out false positives caused by natural language differences (CJK conciseness, German compounds, Spanish morphology, technical cognates), so the remaining issues are high-confidence problems that can be addressed when volunteers become available.

**Why this priority**: Without native speakers available, we must ensure automation is highly accurate. False positives create noise and discouragement. By achieving ≤5 high-severity issues through rule refinement, we can confidently close Issue #16 and wait for volunteer contributions without ongoing maintenance burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by analyzing remaining high-severity issues, identifying linguistic patterns, codifying them as whitelist rules, and measuring reduction in false positive rate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** whitelist rules have been applied, **When** analyzing remaining 19 high-severity issues, **Then** at least 75% can be categorized as additional false positive patterns (linguistic features, not translation errors)
2. **Given** new whitelist rules are added, **When** re-running the audit, **Then** high-severity count reduces to ≤5 issues while maintaining 100% coverage of 433 message keys
3. **Given** a developer commits translation changes, **When** CI/CD runs audit with whitelist, **Then** system only flags genuine issues (e.g., broken placeholders, encoding errors) not linguistic characteristics

---

### User Story 2 - Create Localization Guidelines and Standards (Priority: P3 - Optional)

**Status**: ⏸️ **Paused - Awaiting Volunteer Native Speakers**

**Interim Approach**: Document automation patterns as technical guidelines for future contributors.

Translation contributors and maintainers need clear, language-specific guidelines that explain how to localize (not just translate) Blockly interface elements, so they can create culturally appropriate translations that feel natural to native speakers.

**Why this priority**: Requires native speaker expertise to be effective. Can be deferred until volunteers are available. Current whitelist rules encode linguistic knowledge that can serve as interim documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be started by documenting existing whitelist patterns (CJK conciseness, German compounds, etc.) as interim guidelines. Full validation requires native speaker review.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (Achievable Without Native Speakers):

1. **Given** whitelist rules document linguistic patterns, **When** converting them to markdown guidelines, **Then** future contributors can understand why certain translations are valid (e.g., "CJK languages naturally use 2-4 characters for category names")
2. **Given** interim guidelines exist, **When** a volunteer native speaker joins, **Then** they can validate and expand guidelines with cultural context
3. **Given** automation has reduced false positives, **When** documenting remaining issues, **Then** guidelines can highlight specific patterns that need human judgment (tone, educational context)

---

### User Story 3 - Prioritize and Fix High-Impact Translations (Priority: P4 - Future)

**Status**: ⏸️ **Paused - Requires Native Speaker Validation**

**Preparatory Work (Achievable Now)**: Use machine translation APIs to generate suggested improvements for future volunteer review.

International users of major language markets (Japanese, Korean, German, Traditional Chinese) need their most frequently used interface elements (block categories, common blocks, error messages) to use natural, culturally appropriate phrasing, so they can work efficiently without mental translation overhead.

**Why this priority**: Deferred until native speakers are available. Automated improvements without validation risk making translations worse. Current translations are functional; optimization is enhancement not critical fix.

**Independent Test**: Can prepare by identifying top 20 high-frequency strings per language and generating machine-suggested alternatives. Full validation requires native speaker review and user testing.

**Preparatory Scenarios** (Achievable Without Native Speakers):

1. **Given** audit identifies high-frequency strings, **When** using translation APIs (DeepL, Google Translate), **Then** system generates alternative phrasings for future review
2. **Given** machine-generated suggestions exist, **When** a volunteer native speaker joins, **Then** they can quickly evaluate alternatives instead of starting from scratch
3. **Given** whitelist rules encode linguistic principles, **When** reviewing suggestions, **Then** future volunteers can verify if suggestions follow documented patterns (e.g., CJK conciseness, German compounds)

**Full Scenarios** (Requires Native Speakers - Future Work):

4. **Given** native speaker validates suggestions, **When** implementing approved translations, **Then** measure user comprehension improvement through A/B testing
5. **Given** validated translations deployed, **When** monitoring support requests, **Then** confirm reduction in localization-related confusion issues

---

### User Story 4 - Establish Translation Quality Automation (Priority: P3)

Maintainers need automated checks that detect common localization issues during pull request reviews, so translation quality doesn't degrade over time as new contributors add or modify translations.

**Why this priority**: This ensures long-term sustainability but isn't critical for immediate user impact. Can be implemented after core translations are fixed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing basic checks (character length consistency, placeholder variable preservation, basic pattern matching for direct translations) and running against existing translation files to generate quality reports.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Partially Complete** (2025-10-22)

-   ✅ Whitelist-based false positive filtering implemented
-   ✅ 8 language-aware filtering rules active
-   ✅ Automated audit reports with statistics
-   ⏳ CI/CD integration pending

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - **Given** a contributor submits a pull request with new translations, **When** CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** automated checks flag potential issues like missing placeholders, suspiciously short/long translations, or repeated English words in non-English files
    - **Evidence**: Whitelist system filters 149 false positives across 3 issue types (lengthOverflow, missingTranslation, directTranslation)
    - **Metrics**: 8.8% filter rate with detailed per-rule statistics
    - **CI/CD Behavior (Phase 2)**: Posts non-blocking warning comment; does not fail PR checks; allows reviewer discretion
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - **Given** a translation file is modified, **When** quality checks run, **Then** warnings appear if new strings don't match the grammatical patterns of existing high-quality translations in that language
    - **Evidence**: 8 rules covering CJK conciseness, German compounds, Spanish morphology, cognates, brand names
    - **Examples**:
        - CJK rule filters 92 legitimate short translations
        - German rule handles compound word length naturally
        - Spanish rule allows morphological expansion
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - **Given** monthly translation quality reports are generated, **When** maintainers review them, **Then** they can see trends in translation quality across languages and identify areas needing native speaker review
    - **Evidence**: Comprehensive JSON audit reports in `specs/002-i18n-localization-review/audit-reports/`
    - **Features**:
        - Issue severity breakdown (high/medium/low)
        - Per-language statistics
        - Per-rule filtering effectiveness
        - Frequency-weighted issue ranking

---

### Edge Cases

-   What happens when a technical term has no culturally appropriate equivalent in the target language (e.g., specific hardware sensor names)?
-   How does the system handle languages with multiple regional variants (Portuguese pt-BR, Chinese zh-hant vs zh-hans) to ensure localization reflects the specific region's context?
-   What if a translation needs to be longer than the English version due to language structure, causing UI layout issues?
-   How are pluralization rules handled for languages with different plural forms (e.g., Slavic languages with multiple plural categories)?
-   What happens when educational terminology standards change in a specific country/region?
-   How do we maintain consistency when multiple contributors work on the same language file?
-   **What if ≤5 high-severity issues remain after whitelist optimization but no volunteers available?** → Document issues in detail (key, language, issue type, rationale for non-filtering) and accept as tolerable state (≤1.2% of total keys). Close Issue #16 to acknowledge automation success while preserving issue documentation for future volunteer review.

-   ✅ Audit automation framework (detect + whitelist filtering) - **Implemented**
-   ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD infrastructure - **Available for integration**
-   ✅ Linguistic pattern analysis capabilities (regex, wildcard matching) - **Implemented**

### ⏸️ Blocked Dependencies (Volunteer-Dependent)

-   ⏸️ **BLOCKED**: Native speaker reviewers for validation and approval
-   **Impact**: Cannot validate cultural appropriateness or tone
-   **Workaround**: Focus on technical correctness (placeholders, encoding, structure)

-   ⏸️ **BLOCKED**: User testing participants in target language regions
-   **Impact**: Cannot measure comprehension improvement
-   **Workaround**: Monitor GitHub issues for organic user feedback

-   ⏸️ **BLOCKED**: Cultural context research for educational terminology
-   **Impact**: Cannot optimize for local educational standards
-   **Workaround**: Document known patterns in whitelist rules for future validation

### 🔄 Optional Dependencies (Enhancement Phase)

-   🔄 Translation API access (DeepL, Google Translate) for generating suggestions
-   🔄 Localization glossary from other Arduino education projects
-   🔄 Native speaker recruitment channels (when volunteers available)

## Constitution Alignment

This feature specification aligns with Singular Blockly constitution principles:

-   **Simplicity**: Focuses on improving existing translation content rather than building complex new infrastructure; uses straightforward review and documentation approach
-   **Modularity**: Localization improvements can be made incrementally per language and per UI section without requiring system-wide changes
-   **Avoid Over-Development**: Prioritizes high-impact translations (frequent UI elements) over comprehensive perfection; automation (P3) is deferred until manual processes are proven
-   **Flexibility**: Localization guidelines accommodate different cultural contexts and language structures rather than enforcing one-size-fits-all rules
-   **Research-Driven**: Emphasizes understanding cultural context and educational terminology through native speaker consultation rather than assuming English concepts transfer directly
-   **Structured Logging**: Translation quality issues and reviews will be documented systematically for tracking and future reference
-   **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Localization improvements can be validated through user testing and native speaker review; automated quality checks ensure regression prevention
-   **Pure Functions and Modular Architecture**: Translation content is separate from code logic; quality analysis tools can be built as pure functions analyzing message data structures

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Whitelist System Architecture (User Story 4 - Phase 1)

**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Production Ready

#### System Components

1. **Configuration Layer** - `scripts/i18n/audit-whitelist.json`

    - JSON-based rule definitions
    - 3 issue type categories: lengthOverflow, directTranslation, missingTranslation
    - 8 active filtering rules with language-specific patterns
    - Supports exact key matching and wildcard patterns

2. **Filtering Engine** - `scripts/i18n/lib/whitelist-checker.js`

    - Pure function-based architecture
    - Pattern matching with wildcard support (`.*`, `*`)
    - Per-rule statistics tracking
    - Configurable filtering modes (remove vs. mark)

3. **Integration Point** - `scripts/i18n/audit-translations.js`
    - Post-detection filtering pipeline
    - Statistics recalculation after filtering
    - Backward-compatible with existing workflow

#### Active Filtering Rules

| Rule ID                        | Issue Type         | Languages       | Coverage       | False Positives Filtered |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| cjk-concise-terms              | lengthOverflow     | ja, ko, zh-hant | All keys       | 92 (61.7%)               |
| brand-and-product-names        | missingTranslation | All             | Board names    | 26 (17.4%)               |
| standard-technical-terms       | directTranslation  | All             | CATEGORY\_\*   | 15 (10.1%)               |
| cognates-and-loanwords         | directTranslation  | de, es          | Sensors/Motors | 6 (4.0%)                 |
| external-urls                  | missingTranslation | All             | \*\_HELPURL    | 5 (3.4%)                 |
| german-compound-words          | lengthOverflow     | de              | CATEGORY\_\*   | 2 (1.3%)                 |
| cognates-and-loanwords-missing | missingTranslation | de, es          | TEXT/VARIABLES | 2 (1.3%)                 |
| spanish-natural-expansion      | lengthOverflow     | es              | CATEGORY_MATH  | 1 (0.7%)                 |

#### Performance Metrics

-   **Filter Effectiveness**: 149 false positives removed (8.8% of total)
-   **High-Severity Reduction**: 68.9% (61 → 19 issues)
-   **Processing Overhead**: < 100ms for 1,702 issues
-   **Memory Footprint**: Whitelist rules < 10KB
-   **Maintainability**: JSON schema allows non-developer updates

#### Design Decisions

1. **JSON over Code**: Chose JSON configuration to allow non-developers (translators, linguists) to update rules
2. **Pattern Matching**: Wildcard support balances specificity with maintainability
3. **Post-Detection Filtering**: Keeps detection logic pure; filtering is separate concern
4. **Statistics Preservation**: Original detection counts retained for trend analysis
5. **Language-Aware Rules**: Each rule can target specific languages to avoid over-filtering

#### Rule Governance

**Change Process**: All whitelist rule modifications must follow standard Pull Request workflow with maintainer review approval before merging.

**Rationale**: Balances accessibility (JSON format enables non-developer contributions) with quality control (review ensures rule correctness and prevents over-filtering genuine issues).

**Review Checklist**:

-   Rule pattern specificity (avoids over-broad wildcards)
-   Language targeting accuracy (correct language codes)
-   No conflicts with existing rules
-   Test evidence showing false positive reduction without hiding real issues

#### Audit Report Management

**Retention Policy**: Keep last 6 months of audit reports in `specs/002-i18n-localization-review/audit-reports/` directory.

**Rationale**: Balances trend analysis capability (requires historical comparison) with repository size management (large JSON files can quickly accumulate).

**Cleanup Process**:

-   Monthly automated or manual review of report directory
-   Archive reports older than 6 months to external storage (optional) or delete
-   Retain baseline reports for major milestones indefinitely (e.g., pre-whitelist baseline, issue closure baseline)

#### Future Enhancements (User Story 4 - Phase 2)

-   [ ] CI/CD integration for pull request validation
    -   **Enforcement Mode**: Non-blocking warnings (allow merge with reviewer discretion)
    -   **Rationale**: Whitelist system still optimizing (19→≤5 target); avoid blocking legitimate contributions due to false positives
    -   **Implementation**: GitHub Actions workflow posts comment with audit summary; does not fail PR checks
-   [ ] Rule health monitoring
    -   **Detection Method**: Compare per-rule filtering counts across consecutive audit runs
    -   **Alert Condition**: Rule filters drop to 0 or decrease >80% without corresponding translation file changes
    -   **Action**: Log warning in audit report; flag rule for maintainer review
-   [ ] Web-based rule editor for non-technical contributors
-   [ ] Machine learning-based pattern detection
-   [ ] Per-language confidence scoring
-   [ ] Integration with native speaker review workflow
