# Implementation Plan: Internationalization Localization Quality Review and Improvement

**Branch**: `002-i18n-localization-review` | **Date**: 2025-10-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-i18n-localization-review/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Improve translation quality across 15 supported languages by identifying and fixing direct English translations with culturally appropriate, localized content that feels natural to native speakers.

**Technical Approach**:

-   Create analysis tools to audit existing translation files for localization quality issues
-   Develop language-specific localization guidelines documenting cultural context and educational terminology preferences
-   Prioritize high-impact UI elements (block categories, common blocks, error messages) for native speaker review
-   Establish review workflows with language-specific reviewers for ongoing quality maintenance
-   Defer automation (P3) until manual processes prove effective

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (VSCode extension), JavaScript ES6+ (webview context)  
**Primary Dependencies**: VSCode Extension API, existing languageManager system in webview  
**Storage**: File-based (JSON translation files in `media/locales/*/messages.js`)  
**Testing**: Mocha (existing test framework), manual user testing with native speakers  
**Target Platform**: VSCode Extension Host + WebView (cross-platform: Windows/macOS/Linux)  
**Project Type**: VSCode Extension (single project with extension + webview contexts)  
**Performance Goals**: Translation file load time <100ms, audit analysis <5 seconds for all 15 languages  
**Constraints**: Must preserve existing translation file structure, backward compatible with current languageManager, no external API dependencies  
**Scale/Scope**: 15 language files, ~300-400 translation keys per language, audit/guideline/fix workflow for top 5 languages initially

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Review each core principle from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

-   [x] **Simplicity and Maintainability**: Design focuses on straightforward audit scripts and documentation, not complex infrastructure. Analysis tools are simple file readers and pattern matchers.
-   [x] **Modularity and Extensibility**: Guidelines are per-language, allowing independent work. Audit tool can be extended to check new quality dimensions without rewriting core logic.
-   [x] **Avoid Over-Development**: P1/P2 focus on manual audit and guidelines; P3 automation deferred until processes proven. No speculative translation management system.
-   [x] **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Language-specific guidelines accommodate different cultural contexts. System supports adding new languages or quality checks incrementally.
-   [x] **Research-Driven Development (MCP-Powered)**: Will use MCP tools to research i18n best practices, localization patterns, and cultural terminology standards for each target language.
-   [x] **Structured Logging**: Audit tools will use `log.*` methods for analysis progress and issue reporting (if implemented as extension command) or console output (if CLI script).
-   [x] **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Translation content is data, not code - validation through native speaker review. Audit scripts can be unit tested for pattern matching correctness.
-   [x] **Pure Functions and Modular Architecture**: Audit analysis is pure function (translation file → quality issues list). Guidelines are static documentation. Review workflow is process, not code.

**Research Actions Taken**:

-   [x] Verified i18n best practices using web search for localization vs translation approaches (resolution.de)
-   [x] Reviewed existing translation file structure (`media/locales/*/messages.js`)
-   [x] Analyzed sample translations (en, zh-hant, ja, ko, de) to identify direct translation patterns
-   [x] Confirmed no breaking changes needed to existing languageManager system
-   [x] Researched cultural terminology standards approach for top 5 languages (documented in research.md)
-   [x] Researched Translation Memory and consistency management best practices (lightweight file-based approach)
-   [x] Identified VS Code i18n ecosystem tools (i18n Ally for translation management, 30+ extensions reviewed)
-   [x] Established three-layer validation methodology (automated checks + native speaker review + user testing)

**Testability Assessment**:

-   [x] Audit logic (pattern matching, statistical analysis) can be unit tested with sample data
-   [x] No infinite loops or blocking operations - file reading is bounded
-   [x] Pure function design: translation data → quality report
-   [x] Guidelines are documentation (not code) - validated through native speaker review

**Violations Requiring Justification**: None

**Notes**: This feature is primarily content/process improvement rather than code development. The core deliverables are documentation (guidelines) and data quality improvements (better translations). Minimal code needed - just audit scripts to systematically identify issues. Constitution principles apply more to the audit tooling than the translation content itself.

**Structure Decision**: This is a content/process improvement feature, not a code feature. Primary deliverables are:

1. Documentation (localization guidelines per language)
2. Improved translation content (direct fixes to `media/locales/*/messages.js`)
3. Minimal tooling (audit scripts to systematically identify issues)

No new extension code or architectural changes needed. Existing languageManager system remains unchanged. Audit scripts are standalone Node.js utilities for development workflow, not runtime extension code.

        - Korean: 해요 style (informal polite) for educational context
        - German: Formal Sie avoided, use direct imperative for instructions
        - Traditional Chinese: Standard formal tone without excessive politeness particles
        - Spanish: Tuteo (tú) for educational context, not usted
    - Examples demonstrating appropriate tone

4. **Cultural Context Section**:

    - Localization vs translation philosophy (cultural adaptation > direct translation)
    - Examples from local educational curriculum references
    - Common English idioms that need cultural adaptation

5. **Technical Constraints Section**:

    - Character length considerations (UI rendering limits)
    - Special character handling (quotes, parentheses, punctuation)
    - Placeholder variable preservation ({0}, %1, etc.)

        - [ ] Cultural appropriateness (tone/examples suitable, score 1-5)
        - [ ] Consistency (matches glossary and patterns, score 1-5)
    - Instructions for scoring and providing feedback

**Per-Language Specific Focus**:

-   **Japanese (`guidelines/ja.md`)**:

    -   Katakana vs Kanji for technical terms (research MEXT curriculum)
    -   Particle usage for clarity (は vs が distinctions)

-   **Korean (`guidelines/ko.md`)**:

    -   Honorific level consistency (해요 체 for all UI)
    -   Hangeul vs English loanwords (외래어 표기법)
    -   Spacing rules for compound terms

-   **German (`guidelines/de.md`)**:

    -   Compound word formation (Servomotor vs Servo-Motor)
    -   Capitalization of nouns
    -   Formal vs informal address (use informal imperative)

-   **Traditional Chinese (`guidelines/zh-hant.md`)**:

**Duration**: 5-7 days (guideline writing + glossary compilation + schema definition + validation)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 complete ✅  
**Next Step**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to break down implementation into concrete coding tasks

---

### Phase 2: Implementation Plan (Output: tasks.md via /speckit.tasks)

**Note**: Phase 2 is handled by `/speckit.tasks` command, NOT `/speckit.plan`. This plan document does NOT generate tasks.md.

**Expected Phase 2 Process**:

1. Developer runs `/speckit.tasks` after completing Phase 0-1
2. Agent breaks spec.md User Stories into concrete tasks
3. tasks.md generated with estimates, dependencies, testability notes

**Anticipated Task Categories** (for context only):

-   Audit Tool Development (audit-translations.js, compare-translations.js)
-   Translation Fixes (high-impact strings for top 5 languages)
-   Review Workflow Setup (GitHub issue templates, contributor docs)
-   Quality Validation (native speaker review process)

---

**Phase Handoff**: After completing Phase 1, developer runs `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks.

## Testability Strategy

### Audit Tool Testing

**Unit Tests** (Mocha):

-   `audit-translations.test.ts`: Verify pattern matching logic for direct translation detection
-   Test sample data: Mock translation files with known issues (e.g., "Arduino Uno Board" in Japanese)
-   Expected output: Correct issueType classification (directTranslation vs missingTranslation vs inconsistentTerminology)

**Contract Tests**:

-   Validate audit report output matches `audit-report.schema.json`
-   Validate translation files conform to `translation-file.schema.json`

### Translation Quality Validation

**Manual Testing**:

-   Native speaker review for each of 5 target languages
-   Review checklist: terminology accuracy, cultural appropriateness, tone consistency
-   Before/after comparison using compare-translations.js

**Acceptance Criteria**:

-   Native speaker confirms translations feel "natural" (not machine-translated)
-   Technical terminology matches community standards (per research findings)
-   Educational tone appropriate for target age group (middle/high school students)

### Continuous Validation

**Process**:

-   GitHub pull request template includes "Native speaker review: [ ] Yes/No" checkbox
-   Language-specific reviewers assigned via CODEOWNERS for `media/locales/{lang}/`
-   Audit tool runs in CI to detect new direct translation patterns

**No Automated Testing for**:

-   Cultural appropriateness (subjective, requires human judgment)
-   Tone consistency (native speaker intuition)
-   Educational effectiveness (user testing required)

---

**Test Coverage Target**: 100% for audit tool logic (pattern matching, report generation), Manual validation for translation content quality

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems

**languageManager** (`media/js/blocklyEdit.js`):

-   **Current Behavior**: Loads `media/locales/{lang}/messages.js` based on VSCode language setting
-   **Changes Needed**: None - translation file structure unchanged
-   **Integration**: Improved translations drop-in replace existing content
-   **Testing**: Verify languageManager still loads modified translation files correctly

**LocaleService** (`src/services/localeService.ts`):

-   **Current Behavior**: Maps VSCode language codes to Blockly language codes, loads extension-side messages
-   **Changes Needed**: None - operates at extension level, not WebView
-   **Integration**: No changes to locale detection logic
-   **Testing**: Existing LocaleService tests should still pass

### New Dependencies

**Audit Tools** (scripts/i18n/):

-   **Dependency**: Node.js fs module for reading translation files
-   **Integration**: Run as development scripts (not runtime extension code)
-   **Output**: JSON reports consumed by developers, not end users

**Guidelines** (specs/002-i18n-localization-review/guidelines/):

-   **Dependency**: None (static Markdown documentation)
-   **Integration**: Referenced by contributors via quickstart.md
-   **Output**: Improved translation quality via human review

### External Services

**None**: This feature has zero external service dependencies. All work is file-based and offline.

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Breaking existing translation loading system  
**Mitigation**: Preserve exact file structure (`window.MESSAGES = { ... }`), validate with existing test suite

**Risk**: Inconsistent guidelines across languages  
**Mitigation**: Use common template structure from Phase 0 research, peer review by native speakers

**Risk**: Audit tool false positives  
**Mitigation**: Manual review of audit results, iterative pattern refinement based on feedback

## Deployment Considerations

### Deployment Strategy

**Content Deployment** (Translation Files):

-   **Method**: Direct file replacement in `media/locales/*/messages.js`
-   **Rollout**: Incremental by language (start with Japanese, Korean, German, Traditional Chinese, Spanish)
-   **Rollback**: Git revert to previous translations if native speaker rejects changes
-   **Validation**: Manual review by native speakers before merging

**Tool Deployment** (Audit Scripts):

-   **Method**: Add to repository in `scripts/i18n/`
-   **Usage**: Developer workflow only (not packaged in extension .vsix)
-   **Distribution**: Available to contributors via repository clone

**Guideline Deployment** (Documentation):

-   **Method**: Static Markdown files in `specs/002-i18n-localization-review/guidelines/`
-   **Distribution**: Link from CONTRIBUTING.md or README.md
-   **Updates**: Versioned with spec updates, incorporate native speaker feedback

### Migration Path

**No Migration Needed**: Backward compatible content changes only. Existing extension code unchanged.

**Validation Steps**:

1. Load extension with updated translations
2. Verify all UI strings display correctly in each modified language
3. Confirm no languageManager errors in VSCode Developer Tools console
4. Test common workflows (create block, change board, generate code) in each language

### Monitoring & Rollback

**Monitoring**:

-   GitHub issues tagged with `localization` label for user-reported translation problems
-   Review native speaker feedback in pull request comments
-   Track translation quality via audit tool baseline vs improved metrics

**Rollback Plan**:

-   If translation causes UI rendering issues: Git revert translation file to previous version
-   If native speaker rejects changes: Cherry-pick specific translation key fixes
-   If multiple languages have issues: Pause rollout, revisit Phase 0 research

**Success Metrics**:

-   Zero UI rendering bugs caused by translation changes (technical validation)
-   Native speaker approval for all 5 target languages (content validation)
-   Reduction in direct translation patterns detected by audit tool (quality improvement)

---

**Deployment Timeline**: Incremental rollout over 2-3 weeks, one language per week with native speaker validation
