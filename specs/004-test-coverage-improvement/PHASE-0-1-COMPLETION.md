# Phase 0-1 Completion Summary

**Feature**: Test Coverage Improvement (004)  
**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: ✅ Planning Complete - Ready for Task Breakdown (`/speckit.tasks`)

---

## What We Accomplished

### Phase 0: Research (research.md)

✅ **Answered 5 critical research questions**:

1. **Q1: DI Patterns for VSCode Extensions**

    - Decision: Use function-based injection (\_setVSCodeApi, \_setFileSystem)
    - Rationale: Already proven in logging.ts, simple, type-safe
    - Source: VSCode Extension testing docs + TypeScript DI patterns

2. **Q2: WebView API Mocking**

    - Decision: Fix asWebviewUri in VSCodeMock, add complete WebView structure
    - Root Cause: Missing URI conversion + incomplete lifecycle handling
    - Impact: Fixes 8/8 failing WebViewManager tests

3. **Q3: Test Isolation Scope**

    - Decision: Practical isolation (I/O boundaries only)
    - Scope: Mock VSCode API + filesystem, NOT pure functions
    - Rationale: Per Constitution clarification Q3

4. **Q4: Fail-Fast Implementation**

    - Decision: Add `test:bail` npm script using Mocha --bail flag
    - Approach: Backward compatible (default behavior unchanged)
    - No code changes needed

5. **Q5: Guided Recovery Patterns**
    - Decision: Error templates in testHelpers.ts with remediation steps
    - Pattern: "What went wrong → How to fix → Where to learn more"
    - Links to quickstart.md for detailed guidance

### Phase 1: Design (data-model.md + contracts/ + quickstart.md)

✅ **Created complete design artifacts**:

**1. Data Model (data-model.md)**:

-   5 core entities defined with attributes, behaviors, relationships
-   Entities: Core Component, Isolated Dependency, Test Case, Injection Point, Validation Helper
-   Entity relationship diagram showing data flow
-   Implementation aligned with Constitution (simplicity, modularity)

**2. API Contracts (contracts/)**:

-   `test-helpers.md`: 4 createIsolated*() factories + 2 validate*() helpers
-   `mock-apis.md`: Complete FSMock and VSCodeMock interface specifications
-   All helpers <10 lines, type-safe, with JSDoc examples
-   Critical WebView mock fixes documented (asWebviewUri, onDidDispose)

**3. Developer Guide (quickstart.md)**:

-   8-part guide: First test → Complex tests → Fail-fast → Debugging
-   Reference implementations for FileService and WebViewManager
-   Common patterns + pitfalls with ✅/❌ examples
-   15-minute learning curve target (SC-007)
-   <5 line test setup examples (US-002)

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision Area   | Choice                              | Rationale                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| DI Pattern      | Function-based (\_set\* methods)    | Proven in logging.ts, minimal changes            |
| Mock Structure  | Enhanced VSCodeMock + FSMock        | Complete WebView API, state tracking             |
| Test Helpers    | Factory functions in testHelpers.ts | <5 line setup, type-safe, guided recovery        |
| Fail-Fast       | npm script (test:bail)              | Backward compatible, no code changes             |
| Isolation Scope | I/O boundaries only                 | Per Q3: practical, not full sandboxing           |
| Documentation   | quickstart.md with examples         | 15-min learning curve, reference implementations |

## Constitution Compliance

**All 8 principles verified**:

-   ✅ **Simplicity**: Reuses logging.ts pattern, no new frameworks
-   ✅ **Modularity**: Each service gets independent DI
-   ✅ **No Over-Dev**: Practical isolation, simple fail-fast
-   ✅ **Flexibility**: DI allows runtime swapping
-   ✅ **Research-Driven**: 5 research questions answered with web search + VSCode API docs
-   ✅ **Structured Logging**: Uses existing log.\* pattern
-   ✅ **Test Coverage**: Target 90%+, <60s execution
-   ✅ **Pure Functions**: DI helpers are pure, I/O isolated

**No violations requiring justification**

## What's NOT Included (Phase 2+)

The following are intentionally deferred to `/speckit.tasks` phase:

-   ❌ Task breakdown (tasks.md) - Generated by separate `/speckit.tasks` command
-   ❌ Implementation timeline - Created during task planning
-   ❌ Risk assessment - Part of task execution planning
-   ❌ Actual code changes - Happens during task implementation

**Why**: Per speckit workflow, `/speckit.plan` stops after Phase 1 design. Task breakdown is a separate command.

## Success Metrics Preview

Based on our design, we expect to achieve:

| Metric           | Current       | Target         | Strategy                                  |

## Next Steps

### For Implementation Team

1. **Read the deliverables** (estimated time: 30 minutes):

    - `plan.md` - High-level overview
    - `research.md` - Technical decisions and rationale
    - `quickstart.md` - How to write tests with new pattern

2. **Run `/speckit.tasks`** to generate task breakdown:

    - Command will create `tasks.md` with granular implementation steps
    - Tasks will reference design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/)
    - Timeline and risk assessment generated

3. **Begin implementation** following task order:
    - Recommended order from research.md Q4: logging (reference) → fileService → localeService → settingsManager → webviewManager
    - Use fail-fast mode for rapid iteration
    - Follow quickstart.md patterns for new tests

### For Code Review

**Key files to review**:

1. `plan.md` - Verify technical context and Constitution compliance
2. `research.md` - Validate research findings and decisions
3. `contracts/` - Review API contracts for completeness
4. `quickstart.md` - Verify examples are clear and accurate

**Review criteria**:

-   ✅ All design artifacts reference spec.md requirements
-   ✅ Constitution principles satisfied
-   ✅ No speculative features (per "Avoid Over-Development")
-   ✅ Guided recovery messages actionable
-   ✅ Examples executable and correct
