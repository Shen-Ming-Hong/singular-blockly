# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Coverage Improvement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] CQ-001: No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] CQ-002: Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] CQ-003: Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] CQ-004: All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] RC-001: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] RC-002: Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] RC-003: Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] RC-004: Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] RC-005: All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] RC-006: Edge cases are identified
-   [x] RC-007: Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] RC-008: Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] FR-001: All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] FR-002: User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] FR-003: Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] FR-004: No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning phase

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-18

**Iterations Required**: 2

-   **Iteration 1**: Initial spec contained implementation details (test frameworks, DI patterns, mock classes)
-   **Iteration 2**: Refactored to use technology-agnostic language (quality validation, isolated testing, component architecture)

**Key Changes Made**:

1. Replaced technical terms with business-focused language:
    - "test suite" → "automated quality checks"
    - "dependency injection" → "isolated component testing"
    - "mock" → "isolation mechanisms"
    - "coverage" → "validation coverage"
2. Refocused user stories on outcomes rather than implementation:

    - P1: From "Fix WebView Manager test" to "Achieve complete test suite reliability"
    - P2: From "Implement DI" to "Enable isolated component testing"
    - P3: From "Increase coverage" to "Achieve comprehensive quality validation"

3. Removed all references to specific tools, frameworks, and code structures
4. Success criteria now measure user-facing outcomes rather than technical metrics

**Next Steps**:

-   ✅ Ready for `/speckit.clarify` (no clarifications needed)
-   ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` (can proceed directly to planning)

## Notes

All checklist items passed after refactoring to remove implementation details and focus on business value.
