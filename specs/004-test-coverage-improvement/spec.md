# Feature Specification: Test Coverage Improvement

**Feature Branch**: `004-test-coverage-improvement`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "測試覆蓋率提升：修復最後 1 個失敗測試達到 100% 通過率，實作依賴注入於所有服務層，提升測試覆蓋率至 90%+"

## Terminology

This specification uses consistent terminology:

-   **Validation / Quality Checks** (user-facing): Automated verification procedures that ensure code quality and correctness
-   **Tests / Test Cases** (implementation-facing): Unit tests, integration tests, and test files written by developers
-   **Coverage**: Measured as line coverage (primary metric) and branch coverage (secondary metric) using nyc/Istanbul
-   **Component**: A business logic module requiring isolated testing (FileService, SettingsManager, LocaleService, WebViewManager)

_Note: "Validation" is used when describing user-facing behavior; "tests" is used when describing implementation details in plan.md and tasks.md._

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

-   Q: When validation checks encounter edge cases (hybrid isolation, async operations, execution order issues, file system errors, state cleanup failures), what should the system do? → A: Fail-fast mode - immediately stop and report the first encountered problem for quick feedback
-   Q: After validation fails (detecting defects or environment issues), what recovery path should the system provide for developers to quickly resume work? → A: Guided recovery - provide clear error messages and fix suggestions, allow re-running failed checks
-   Q: In isolated testing, which types of dependencies must be isolated versus allowed to remain real? → A: Practical isolation - isolate all I/O operations (file system, network, platform APIs) but allow pure computation and memory operations
-   Q: As test suite expands with more tests, how much execution time growth is acceptable? → A: Linear scaling with absolute cap - allow execution time to grow proportionally with test count but never exceed 60 seconds maximum
-   Q: What level of detail should isolation pattern documentation include for future developers? → A: Practical documentation - multiple real examples, common pitfalls, best practices checklist (balances usability with maintenance)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Achieve Complete Test Suite Reliability (Priority: P1)

As a **developer maintaining the codebase**, I need all automated quality checks to pass so that code changes can be validated quickly and regressions are caught early.

**Why this priority**: This is blocking the ability to trust automated quality checks. When checks fail unexpectedly, teams lose confidence in the entire validation system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all automated quality checks complete successfully. Delivers immediate value by restoring trust in quality validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes are made, **When** automated quality checks run, **Then** all checks pass successfully
2. **Given** a developer validates their changes, **When** the validation completes, **Then** results accurately reflect code quality
3. **Given** quality validation completes, **When** results are reviewed, **Then** no false failures are reported
4. **Given** a validation check fails, **When** the developer reviews the error, **Then** clear error messages and actionable fix suggestions are provided
5. **Given** a developer fixes a validation failure, **When** they re-run validation, **Then** only the previously failed check is re-executed

---

### User Story 2 - Enable Isolated Component Testing (Priority: P2)

As a **developer writing tests**, I need each system component to be testable in isolation so that I can verify functionality without depending on external systems.

**Why this priority**: This enables comprehensive quality validation. When components are tightly coupled, it's difficult to test individual features and pinpoint defects.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that each core component (file operations, configuration management, internationalization, user interface management) can be validated independently. Delivers value by enabling thorough quality checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component needs testing, **When** tests are executed, **Then** all I/O operations (file system, network, platform APIs) are isolated while computation remains real
2. **Given** tests run for a component, **When** external I/O systems are unavailable, **Then** tests still execute successfully using isolated substitutes
3. **Given** a component's behavior is validated, **When** test isolation is used, **Then** results accurately reflect the component's business logic
4. **Given** multiple components exist, **When** each is tested, **Then** tests can run independently without shared I/O state interference

---

### User Story 3 - Achieve Comprehensive Quality Validation (Priority: P3)

As a **project maintainer**, I need comprehensive validation of code behavior so that I can confidently make changes, catch defects early, and maintain high quality standards.

**Why this priority**: While important for long-term maintainability, this depends on P1 and P2 being complete. It's the final polish step rather than foundational work.

**Independent Test**: Can be measured by tracking what percentage of code paths have been validated. Delivers value by providing confidence that changes won't introduce defects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** components support isolated testing, **When** validation coverage is measured, **Then** more than 90% of code paths are validated
2. **Given** edge cases are identified, **When** validation is performed, **Then** error handling and boundary conditions are verified
3. **Given** critical functionality exists, **When** coverage is assessed, **Then** key operations (logging, file handling, language support, UI management) show >95% validation
4. **Given** new features are added, **When** validation is required, **Then** the architecture makes it straightforward to add quality checks

### Edge Cases

-   **Hybrid isolation scenario**: When a component is tested with only some dependencies isolated, validation MUST fail immediately with a clear error indicating incomplete isolation setup
-   **Asynchronous operations**: System MUST fail-fast if async validation operations time out or throw unhandled errors, reporting the specific async operation that failed
-   **Unexpected execution order**: When validation checks are executed in an unexpected order, the system MUST detect order dependencies and fail immediately with a clear error
-   **File system errors**: Quality checks MUST fail immediately when encountering file system access errors or permission issues, reporting the specific file path and error type
-   **State cleanup failures**: When a validation check doesn't properly clean up its state, the next check MUST detect the polluted state and fail immediately with a clear diagnostic message

## Constitution Alignment

This feature specification aligns with Singular Blockly constitution principles:

-   **Simplicity**: Uses standard isolation patterns without introducing complex validation frameworks
-   **Modularity**: Each component can be validated independently with minimal setup
-   **Avoid Over-Development**: Implements only what's needed for quality validation - builds on existing infrastructure
-   **Flexibility**: Architecture allows easy extension to new validation scenarios and component variations
-   **Research-Driven**: Will leverage existing patterns from successfully validated components as reference models
-   **Structured Logging**: Validation infrastructure will use standardized logging for debugging validation failures
-   **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Primary goal of this feature - achieving 90%+ validation coverage with reliable, maintainable quality checks
-   **Pure Functions and Modular Architecture**: Components will be structured to separate pure business logic from side effects where possible

## Assumptions

-   Existing quality validation infrastructure is adequate and will not require replacement
-   Coverage measurement tools are available or will be added to project dependencies
-   Current validation structure is well-organized and will be preserved
-   Platform testing environment provides sufficient isolation capabilities
-   Backward compatibility is required - existing functionality must continue working unchanged
-   Target validation coverage of 90% is realistic given current codebase maturity (98.5% checks already passing)

## Dependencies

-   Completion depends on understanding current UI management validation failure root cause
-   May require updates to validation infrastructure to add missing platform isolation capabilities
-   Requires documenting isolation patterns in contribution guidelines with:
    -   Multiple working examples covering each core component type
    -   Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guide
