# Specification Quality Checklist: MicroPython Custom Function Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

-   [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-   [x] Focused on user value and business needs
-   [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-   [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

-   [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-   [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-   [x] Success criteria are measurable
-   [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-   [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-   [x] Edge cases are identified
-   [x] Scope is clearly bounded
-   [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

-   [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-   [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
-   [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-   [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

-   規範已完整，無需進一步澄清
-   已基於對話中的技術討論做出合理假設並記錄在 Assumptions 區塊
-   邊緣情況已識別，可在實作階段進一步細化
