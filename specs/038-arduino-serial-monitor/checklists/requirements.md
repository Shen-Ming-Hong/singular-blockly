# Specification Quality Checklist: Arduino Serial Monitor 整合

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 規格完整通過所有驗證項目
- 所有 User Story 都有明確的優先級和獨立測試方式
- 假設條件已在 Assumptions 區塊清楚列出
- 無需額外澄清即可進入 `/speckit.plan` 或 `/speckit.clarify` 階段
