# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Review each core principle from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

-   [ ] **Simplicity and Maintainability**: Does the design avoid unnecessary complexity? Are components self-documenting?
-   [ ] **Modularity and Extensibility**: Can new features be added without major refactoring? Are concerns properly separated?
-   [ ] **Avoid Over-Development**: Is this feature truly needed now? Does it deliver core value without speculative additions?
-   [ ] **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Will the implementation support future boards/languages/configurations without code changes?
-   [ ] **Research-Driven Development (MCP-Powered)**: Have you used MCP tools to verify library versions, API compatibility, and best practices?
-   [ ] **Structured Logging**: Are all diagnostic outputs using the standardized logging service (`log.*` methods)?
-   [ ] **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Is the code designed to be 100% testable? Does it avoid infinite loops and blocking operations in tests?
-   [ ] **Pure Functions and Modular Architecture**: Are functions pure where possible? Is business logic separated from side effects?

**Research Actions Taken**:

-   [ ] Verified library documentation using MCP `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` tools
-   [ ] Checked for API breaking changes using web search
-   [ ] Confirmed compatibility with current Blockly/VSCode/PlatformIO versions
-   [ ] Documented research findings: [LINK TO RESEARCH.MD OR INLINE NOTES]

**Testability Assessment**:

-   [ ] All business logic can be tested without external dependencies
-   [ ] No infinite loops or blocking operations that prevent test execution
-   [ ] Pure functions identified and separated from side effects
-   [ ] Dependency injection used for testable module boundaries

**Violations Requiring Justification**: [None / List any unavoidable violations with rationale]

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
