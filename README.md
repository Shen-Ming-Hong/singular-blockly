# Singular Blockly

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides a visual programming interface using Blockly for Arduino development.

## Features

This extension integrates Blockly's visual programming interface with Arduino development, making it easier to create Arduino programs using a block-based programming approach.

Key features include:

- Visual block programming interface for Arduino
- Built-in blocks for Arduino I/O operations
- Support for functions, variables, loops, and logic operations
- Custom Arduino-specific blocks
- Integrated development environment within VS Code
